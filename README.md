# UI-UX-Experiment1

## Aim:
To study and understand the fundamentals of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design, including their definitions, core elements, differences, design process, real-world applications, and commonly used UI/UX tools.

## Algorithm:

Step 1: Start by learning what UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) mean.

Step 2: Study the main elements of UI such as layout, colors, typography, icons, and buttons.

Step 3: Study the main elements of UX such as user research, information structure, interaction flow, usability, and accessibility.

Step 4: Understand the difference between UI and UX and how they work together.

Step 5: Learn the design process which includes researching, creating wireframes, designing visuals, building prototypes, and testing.

Step 6: Observe real-life examples like Instagram, Uber, Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, and Duolingo to understand how UI and UX are applied.

Step 7: Explore the tools used for UI and UX design such as Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, Miro, Balsamiq, and InVision.

Step 8: Finally, summarize your understanding of how UI and UX together create a complete and user-friendly product.
